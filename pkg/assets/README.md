# Days in Turkey Telegram Bot Assets
Here we have assets used in our bot configuration. Currently, we control Countries and Internationalization. I also planned to have a Penalty calculator here but in practice, it doesn't work.

## Country Configs
Check `assets/country/.template` for a sample.  
Useful resources:  
- Language and Country Codes lookup [iana.org](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry)
- Country Flag lookup [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/)

## Internationalization
Check `assets/i18n/en.toml` for a sample.  
Useful resources:  
- Golang i18n I used [nicksnyder/go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n)
